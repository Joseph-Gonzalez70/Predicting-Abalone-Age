# Predicting-Abalone-Age
Before using models to predict abalone age, biologists used microscopes to count the number of rings within the abalone’s shell. This task, which includes cutting and staining the shell’s cone, is laborious and requires high attention to details. To avoid this procedure, biologists hope to use physical measurements to predict abalone age. The goal of this project is to determine whether certain measurements can be used to predict abalone age. 

To see the variables and references involved in this project, refer to the "abalone dataset description.pdf."

NOTE TO VIEWER: This project was my first statistical project. While I am happy with the various concepts used in my project, I have learned many new analysis techniques and R functions that I would have preferred to use in this project. For example, I would have used k-fold cross-validation(instead of validation set approach) to measure each model's predictive performance. I also would have preferred to use R commands(like vif(), ggplot(), filter(), etc.) and more functions to better organize the code.
